 ANALYSIS TOOLS - Deepak Cherian
------------------------------------

General:
	- Derived quantities
		- energy
		- pv
		- Richardson number
		- Burger number
	- movie with changes w.r.t previous time step

ROMS
	- roms_info
		- fix IC plotting
			
	*** roms_energy
		- roms_extract
		- fix offset when using multiple slabs
	
	- add roms_extract to mod_movie, roms_pv, roms_energy
	- stat.m and subfunctions
	
	- ROMS TIMESTEP [3 4] bug!!!
					& [1 5] gives 2 4 5 wtf?
					
	- remove length scale calculation when EKE is small
	
	*** roms_pv
		- add file exists? check	
		- fix use of mean f
		- add intPV
		- throw out edges

	- SI analysis tools
	     - steppiness
	     - spreading of cells
		 - write energy transfer calculation code
		 - compute theoretical SI & BI length scales from output fields
		 - PV fluxes through boundaries - possibly not very useful right now.
		
Improvements:
	- find_file
		
	- convergence.m
		- make into function form
		- robust checking of dimensions to exit gracefully from errors
		
	- linex, liney 
		- help comments
		- fix monotonic axis error
	- fix corr_sig and confnorm
	- LaPrint
	- get matlab to compile
