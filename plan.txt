 ANALYSIS TOOLS - Deepak Cherian
------------------------------------

General:
	- Derived quantities
		- Burger number
	- movie with changes w.r.t previous time step

ROMS			
	*** roms_energy
		- roms_extract
	
	- add roms_extract to mod_movie, roms_pv, roms_energy
	- stat.m and subfunctions
		
	*** roms_pv
		- fix use of mean f
		- throw out edges

	- SI analysis tools
	     - spreading of cells
		 - write energy transfer calculation code
		 - compute theoretical BI length scales from output fields
		 
	- animate.m
		- fix fonts
		- add beautify
		- round off axis labels to given decimal place
		
Improvements:
	- find_file
		
	- convergence.m
		- make into function form
		- robust checking of dimensions to exit gracefully from errors
		
	- linex, liney 
		- help comments
		- fix monotonic axis error
	- fix corr_sig and confnorm
	- LaPrint
	- get matlab to compile
	
	- update initial conditions ROMS script to newest version
	- make analysis tools model-agnostic
	- rename all of my roms_ tools to dc_roms
	- ROMS grid / initial conditions creation like parker's?
	- streamfunction code.
	- generalize momentum / vorticity balance code
	- add correction to z-grid for free surface motion in all ROMS tools
	- need to add bathymetry (land/sea mask) to mod_movie
		- fix z-grid usage and add zeta correction
		- change x_ to lon_
		- use all grids as arrays not vectors
	- generalize getting variable grid from netcdf files
	- make scripts accept folder input
