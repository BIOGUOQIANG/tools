After unpacking the netcdf toolbox, you should adjust your matlab path
as follows.  

addpath /path/to/wherever/you/installed/this/netcdf 
addpath /path/to/wherever/you/installed/this/netcdf/nctype
addpath /path/to/wherever/you/installed/this/netcdf/ncutility

or if on Windows, 

addpath C:\path\to\wherever\you\installed\this\netcdf 
addpath C:\gpath\to\wherever\you\installed\this\netcdf\nctype
addpath C:\path\to\wherever\you\installed\this\netcdf\ncutility

It could reside on another drive as well.

And remember to remove any previous version of the netcdf toolbox from
your path as well.

Windows Users Take Note:
========================================================================
The "netcdf.dll" should be somewhere on your windows system path, BUT
NOT on your matlab path.  If you type

    >> which ( 'netcdf', '-all' );

from the matlab command line, you should only see one m-file, and you
shouldn't see the DLL at atll.


AUTOSCALING
========================================================================
If you wish to automatically scale your data and have fill values replaced
by NaNs, you should define a global structure called "nctbx_options"
as follows:

    >> global nctbx_options;
    >> nctbx_options.theAutoscale = 1;
    >> nctbx_options.theAutoNaN = 1;

You can place this code in your startup.m if you don't want to continually
have to do this upon starting matlab.
